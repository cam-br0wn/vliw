# RISC-(V)LIW

## About
This is a very rudimentary implementation of a VLIW RISC-V architecture does as an independent project at Northwestern University. No compiler has been written for this architecture, and as such, it's pretty much useless.

## Features
1. Four 3-stage in-order pipelines: two IXU, branch/jmp, and LSU.
2. Forwarding unit
3. That's it.
