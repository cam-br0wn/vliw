To-do list:
- figure out timing with program counter 
    - accessing memory with PC x will take a cycle to hit pipeline
    - branch unit needs this PC, but not too early
- implement stalling when loads happen
- implement variable size stores (might need to modify way mem is read)
- fix branch length sign extension (branch imm length is different from jal)
- test branching
- test hazards
- test stalling
